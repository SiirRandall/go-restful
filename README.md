# Go-Restful App

Welcome to the `go-restful` repository. This application is designed to be a tool similar to Postman, allowing users to interact with and test RESTful APIs using Go. It's currently in the `test-features` branch, which means it's undergoing active development and testing.

## ⚠️ Work in Progress ⚠️

Please be aware that this is a **work in progress**. There are lots of bugs and debugging statements scattered throughout the code. We're actively working on refining and improving the codebase. Your patience and contributions are much appreciated!

## Features

`go-restful` aims to:

- Allow users to send requests to APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- Display API responses in a user-friendly format.
- Save and manage collections of API requests.
- Generate code snippets to incorporate the API requests into your language of choice.
- Offer a modular and scalable codebase for future enhancements.
